# GitHub-Docker-and-Jenkins-CI-CD-Pipeline
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Docker and Jenkins. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring efficiency and consistency in software development workflows.

The CI/CD pipeline involves the following steps:

GitHub Push: The process begins when code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
Jenkins Build Trigger: Jenkins, our automation server, is configured to monitor the GitHub repository for changes. Upon detecting a new commit, Jenkins triggers the build process.
Docker Image Creation: Jenkins pulls the base Docker image from DockerHub and builds a Docker image containing the application and its dependencies.
Docker Image Push: Once the Docker image is built successfully, Jenkins pushes the image to DockerHub, making it available for deployment.
Update Status: Jenkins updates the build status on GitHub, providing visibility into the CI/CD process.
Notification: Users are notified of the build status through GitHub notifications.
